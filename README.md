Xp Decay
===========

A [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/) [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin written as a one-off for a server PvE event.

Causes XP to decay until it reaches zero, at which point the player explodes. On respawn, XP is reset to the maximum for level 50.

Dependencies
------------
Written in Clojure, this plugin requires [clj-minecraft](https://github.com/CmdrDats/clj-minecraft) for the Clojure libraries and to load it with the proper classloader.

Development
-----------
Xp Decay has been purpose-built for a specific server and event. Pull requests may be accepted depending on the features/fixes introduced, the quality of the code and tests and how much time I have.

Compatibility
-------------
Incraftible has been tested with the following:

* CraftBukkit 1.1-R4

Planned Features
----------------
Planned feature is to get it working. Nothing much beyond that.
